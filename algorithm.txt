So duplicate files present across 2 drives
choose 1 master, 1 slave
In the end, you want all the duplicate files on master, and only leftovers on slave (or some other layout)

Assign master, slave

hash all files on both drives
	- look for folders of all same hash?

(remove duplicates within slave first? copy first, then move both to master -- this will have space issues.  Set a threshold and ask user?)
	msgbox( a large file was found, how to proceed?)

compare lists, see what matches, see what dirs match
get dirs

copy/move to dirs.  If name same, overwrite, if not, copy but note in log or make special log just for this


Things to consider:
permissions
check to make sure actually copies to right dir with some kind of test heirarchy
maybe use thumbdrive to check drive letter shit
	-use two thumbdrives

might need to play wiht strings for a bit to learn how to assemble lists.  must be fluent in this to fuck with whole HDD of data

put a log or SOMETHING to know what the damn thing is doing with the data.  ideally log and print status.
	- log must include filename, action (cp/mv), srcdir, destdir, timestamp
try putting ini/systme shit to see if it throws weird error
	- if thrown, ignore and log in warnings.log

the tree structure might be difficult....

ERROR ON THE SIDE OF COPYING TOO  MUCH SHIT

but this is probably the best way to go about this at this point


The test:
make file structure on two thumbdrives
multiple folders, different filenames

different name, same hash
same name, same hash
foldername1 of filehash1, foldername2 of filehash1
large files
system files


It should check for same name, diff hash, as possible updated/old versions of an item
- what about file size?
- move to folder on master
